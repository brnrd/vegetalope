So as a good concerned netcitizen, I was there, reading the cookies policy on a website I was on (as you do) living my best life, when I noticed a small link at the bottom that said:

> We also use Google Analytics Advertising Features. Read more about it and how you can opt out here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)

<span class="more"></span>

Well ok, now you got me interested. Just to think that there was a hidden thing somewhere to completely opt-out of Google Analytics got me all reved up.

> Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on

What now? A browser extension? Supported by Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Firefox and Opera?
I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed.
Ok, let's check this out. Last updated April 2019, 4 out of 5 stars, 1M+ users. Wow, just wow. I mean, you have to be pretty motivated to just block GA and that's it. And by blocking I mean, loading the script, running it, just not pushing the data to Google. But that something I guess right? RIGHT?

Oh wait, what do I see now?

[IBA Opt-out (by Google)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/interest-advertising-opt-out/)! An extension, made by Google, to opt-out the Interest Based Advertising thing. Only half a million users, 3 out of 5 stars. Ouch. Does it mean you're not going to get ads? Well no, of course not. Just it won't be "pertinent", not based on your activity. And it apparently breaks the web too, since it was last updated in August 2013, and people dropping reviews are not too happy about it (but who leaves positive feedback amirite?).
That might be nice if you don't want to block ads on your favourite websites and still block Google from knowing everything about you.

With that in mind, if you want to go above and beyond, why not bother with those.
Personally I'll stick with [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).
