To find comfortable shoes when you have wide feet is no easy feat (pun intended).

When you want vegan-friendly shoes too, it makes it twice as difficult.

I’ve found Vivobarefoot 2 years ago and I just ordered an additional pair, more winter focused. They are both incredibly comfortable and environmentally friendly.

They are expensive, but my 2yo pair is nowhere near end of life, and it was almost the only thing I wore since I got them.

I view them as an investment on my health, and if I only keep them 2 additional years, it would be like getting a 40€ pair/year. Fine.

I say almost because to ride my bike, I also have a pair of Vans Customs, since they are available in wide size and you get to pick your favourite shoe design. Natural gum, leopard print, and black laces are still my go-to. And of course some models are vegan-friendly.

Be kind on your feet, incidentally your knees, your hips, and in the long run (no pun intended this time) your wallet by getting some proper shoes.

You’ll be hopefully as thankful as I am now.
