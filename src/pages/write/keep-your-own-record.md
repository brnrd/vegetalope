Most people underestimate how quickly work disappears.

Not because it wasn’t valuable, but because it became normal. Shipped features fade into the background. Refactors become invisible once they hold. Support given quietly, decisions unblocked, risks avoided all dissolve into “that’s just how things are”.

This is why keeping track of your own achievements matters, regardless of your role.

## Memory is not a system

Managers are human. They forget.  
Some are overwhelmed. Some are inexperienced. Some are simply bad at keeping a running picture of what actually happened over a year.

Even good managers struggle with scale, recency bias, and context switching.

Relying on someone else’s memory to fairly represent your work is optimistic at best.

Keeping your own record is not distrust.  
It is realism.

## This is not about ego

Tracking achievements is often misread as self-promotion.

It isn’t.

It’s about being able to answer basic professional questions with evidence:
- Did I meet my objectives?
- Where did I go beyond them?
- How did my impact evolve over time?
- Am I operating at my current level, or already at the next one?

Without a record, these answers default to feelings and vague impressions. With a record, they become concrete.

## What is worth tracking

This is not a list of tickets closed.

Track things that would be hard to reconstruct later:
- Spontaneous refactors that reduced complexity or risk
- Incidents prevented, not just incidents resolved
- Cross-team support, mentoring, or unblockings
- Presentations, demos, or showcases
- Design or architectural decisions that held over time
- Initiatives taken without being explicitly asked
- Ownership assumed outside your formal scope

If it felt slightly uncomfortable or required initiative, it probably belongs on the list.

## Read the next level, not just your own

One of the most effective filters is this:

> Would this be expected at my level, or at the next one?

Career paths and role expectations exist for a reason. Reading only your current level keeps you reactive. Reading the next level gives you a direction.

If you consistently find yourself doing work that maps to the next level, you want that to be visible. Not as a claim, but as a pattern.

Patterns matter more than isolated wins.

## When this record becomes useful

You don’t collect this information to wave it around weekly.

It becomes valuable when:
- your manager asks you to self-assess
- ratings are calibrated across teams
- objectives are reviewed at the end of the year
- compensation is discussed
- scope or role changes are considered
- a new manager joins mid-cycle

In those moments, having a clear, chronological record turns an emotional conversation into a grounded one.

## This applies at every level

Developers use it to grow and be recognised.  
Engineering managers use it to avoid vague narratives.  
Heads of Engineering use it to retain signal across time and scale.

The higher you go, the less your impact is visible in code and the more it lives in decisions, systems, and people. That makes it even easier to forget and even harder to reconstruct.

## How I do it, concretely

Personally, I keep this record directly in Slack, using a Canvas.

Slack is a tool I’m already in every day. That matters. The best system is the one you actually use, not the most elaborate one. Having it there means I don’t forget to update it, and I can quickly jot things down while context is still fresh.

I also rely on small habits:
- a recurring reminder at the end of the week to add anything notable
- bookmarks on discussions, decisions, or messages worth revisiting later
- quick notes when something goes beyond what was expected, even if it felt minor at the time

The format doesn’t matter much.  
A document, a note, a task list, a Canvas, a private channel. Whatever fits your workflow.

What matters is that it’s lightweight, close at hand, and revisited regularly. If it requires effort, it won’t survive the year.

You don’t do this for today.  
You do it for your future self.

When self-assessment season comes around, you’ll love yourself for having kept track. No guesswork, no vague memories, just facts and patterns you can rely on.

## Professional hygiene

Keeping track of your achievements is not about gaming the system.

It is about:
- fairness
- clarity
- continuity
- and respecting your own work enough not to let it vanish

You don’t need a fancy tool. A simple document, updated regularly, is enough.

The important part is the habit.

Do the work.  
Keep the record.  
Let the facts speak when it matters.
