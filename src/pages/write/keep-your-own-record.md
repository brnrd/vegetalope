Work fades faster than you expect.

Not because it wasn’t useful, but because it became normal. Features ship and become part of the product. Refactors hold and no one thinks about them again. The small decisions, the unblockings, the extra ownership quietly blend into the background.

After a few months, even you forget parts of it. That’s why I keep a record, and why you should too.

## Memory is unreliable

Managers forget. So do we. A year is long. Context shifts. Priorities change. What felt important in March is hard to reconstruct in November.

Even good managers rely, unintentionally, on what is recent or visible. That’s just how memory works.

Keeping your own notes isn’t about distrust. It’s about accepting that memory is not a system.

## It’s not about self-promotion

Tracking what you’ve done can feel awkward. It can look like you’re trying to build a case.

In reality, it’s much simpler than that.

At some point you will be asked:
- How did the year go?
- Did you meet your objectives?
- Where did you stretch?
- Are you already operating at the next level?

Without notes, you end up reconstructing from fragments. With notes, you can see patterns. You can see where you took initiative, where you grew, where you carried more than expected.

It becomes calmer. More factual. Less emotional.

## What I actually write down

I don’t track everything. I don’t list tickets.

I write down the things I know I won’t remember clearly in six months:

- Refactors that reduced complexity
- Risks avoided before they became incidents
- Cross-team help that wasn’t in my formal scope
- Presentations or internal demos
- Decisions that held over time
- Moments where I stepped slightly beyond my level

If something required initiative or felt slightly uncomfortable, it’s usually worth noting.

## Read one level above

One habit that helps is reading the expectations for the level above yours.

Not to claim it prematurely, but to orient yourself. If you consistently see your work mapping there, it’s useful to have examples ready. Not as a speech, just as evidence of a pattern.

Patterns are easier to discuss than isolated wins.

## When it matters

Most of the year, this document just sits there.

Then self-assessment season comes. Or compensation discussions. Or scope changes. Or a new manager joins.

That’s when it becomes useful.

Instead of trying to remember what happened, you have a timeline. Instead of vague impressions, you have examples. You don’t need to oversell anything. The work speaks for itself.

You’ll be glad you kept it.

## How I keep mine

I use a Slack Canvas.

Mainly because I’m already in Slack every day. It’s easy to update. If something notable happens, I can add a line while it’s still fresh.

I also set a small weekly reminder and bookmark conversations that might be relevant later.

The tool doesn’t matter much. A document, a note, a private channel. What matters is that it’s close enough to your daily workflow that it doesn’t feel like extra work.

If it feels heavy, you won’t keep it up.

## That’s it

This isn’t about gaming reviews. It’s about not letting your own work dissolve into the background.

Do your job.  
Keep a light record.  
Make future conversations easier.
