I stumbled upon [Travis Hubbard on X](https://twitter.com/wtravishubbard) recently, and was reading a [tweet](https://twitter.com/wtravishubbard/status/1716451033277190148) of his stating that "[we]'re all punks too".


It made me realise that a lot of how I think about engineering, leadership, and even family life can be summed up by one word: **punk**. Not loud or chaotic, but independent, intentional, and grounded in reality.

These principles guide how I make decisions, run teams and systems, and adapt under real constraints.

Here’s my take on **PUNK**:


## Pragmatic

Pragmatic means being honest about reality and acting accordingly.

At home or at work, someone has to decide. Not everything needs consensus, and not everything deserves endless discussion. Input matters, but clarity matters more. Once enough is known, a call is made and owned.

Trade-offs are named rather than avoided.  
Time versus comfort. Stability versus flexibility. Depth versus breadth. Pretending there is a perfect option only delays movement. Pragmatism accepts that every choice costs something and chooses consciously.

Energy is treated as a finite resource.  
Whether it’s family logistics, learning, or building things, attention is spent where it actually changes outcomes. Details that do not meaningfully improve life or results are simplified or dropped.

Quality is defined by usefulness, not ideals.  
In life as in engineering, “good enough” is often the right target. Reliable, understandable, and adaptable beats perfect-but-fragile. What matters is that things work, hold under stress, and can evolve.

Reality is the final judge.  
Plans, principles, and intentions are hypotheses. Living with the consequences, day after day, is what validates them. Adjustments are made based on lived experience, not attachment to past decisions.

Pragmatism is not cynicism or laziness.  
It is respect for time, energy, and momentum. It is choosing progress over posturing and coherence over appearances.

The mindset is simple:
- Decide when it matters  
- Simplify what doesn’t  
- Act, observe, adjust  
- Keep moving  

Being pragmatic is about building a life and a body of work that actually holds together when reality pushes back.

## Unconventional

Unconventional is about not outsourcing your thinking, without opting out of the collective.

It starts with questioning defaults.  
How teams are structured. How success is measured. How a family organises learning, movement, or priorities. Common choices are not wrong by default, but they are still hypotheses. They deserve to be examined rather than inherited.

Unconventional does not mean doing your own thing in isolation.  
It means thinking independently before aligning deliberately. Ideas are challenged, explored, and stress-tested, but once a direction is chosen, it is carried together.

Values are made explicit so decisions stay legible.  
When people understand why a choice is different, trust replaces confusion. Unconventional paths work when they are explained, documented, and revisited, not when they rely on personal intuition or unspoken assumptions.

This applies as much at home as at work.  
Living differently only works if it remains understandable, sustainable, and supportive for everyone involved. Independence without shared context quickly turns into friction.

Unconventional thinking is therefore not rebellion for its own sake.  
It is the discipline of choosing differently when it makes things simpler, healthier, or more coherent, while staying aligned with the people you build and live with.

The boundary is clear:
- Think for yourself  
- Decide together  
- Move as one system  

That balance is what keeps unconventional choices from becoming noise.

## Nimble

Nimble is adaptability with an anchor.

Living with change teaches you quickly what matters and what doesn’t. When contexts shift often, you learn to keep things simple, travel light, and avoid over-investing in arrangements that won’t survive the next turn. Fewer possessions, fewer brittle plans, more room to adjust.

But nimbleness is not the absence of structure.  
It is the ability to move because some things are stable. Values, standards, and a small set of non-negotiables create the backbone that allows everything else to flex.

In practice, this means choosing rigidity deliberately.  
Interfaces, safety rules, security constraints, hiring principles, and shared language are made firm so that execution, tactics, and day-to-day decisions can adapt without chaos.

This applies equally outside of work.  
Family rhythms, expectations, and core principles provide continuity, while locations, schedules, and methods can change. Stability at the centre makes movement at the edges possible.

Direction is preserved even when plans change.  
Being nimble is not reacting to everything. It is knowing what must hold and what can move, and adjusting without losing coherence.

Nimbleness does not beat rigidity.  
It depends on it.

The balance looks like this:
- Fix the foundations  
- Loosen the edges  
- Adapt without drift  

That is how systems, teams, and lives remain both resilient and free to evolve.

## Keen

*Keen* is one of those words that sounds almost Australian. The kind of energy you hear in someone like Beau Miles. Curious, enthusiastic, quietly adventurous.

At this level, curiosity is a given.  
What matters is what you do with it.

Being keen means staying interested without chasing novelty for its own sake. It is choosing to keep learning even when you could rely on experience alone. Exploring new tools, ideas, and paths, not to collect them, but to see which ones actually matter.

Keen is directed curiosity.  
Attention is placed where it compounds: understanding systems more deeply, noticing patterns across time, and connecting ideas that live far apart. The goal is not to know everything, but to keep sharpening judgement.

This applies beyond work.  
The same energy that pushes someone up a hill, into a long walk, or into an unfamiliar place also fuels patience with people, openness to change, and the willingness to try again after failure.

Keen does not mean impulsive.  
It means engaged. Present. Willing to put in the effort when something is worth exploring, and comfortable saying no when it isn’t.

The signal is simple:
- Curious, but selective  
- Open, but grounded  
- Adventurous, but responsible  

Keen is not about potential.  
It is about sustained interest over time, and the quiet confidence that there is always more to understand.


## How this shows up in practice

**Pragmatic**  
When delivery and engineering ideals conflict, I make the trade-off explicit, decide quickly, and optimise for learning in production rather than theoretical completeness.

**Unconventional**  
I actively invite dissent and alternative proposals, but I am strict about alignment once a decision is made. Debate is encouraged; stalling execution is not.

**Nimble**  
I design teams, systems, and roadmaps so that change is cheap and reversible, while keeping a small set of standards and constraints deliberately stable.

**Keen**  
I expect learning and experimentation to be part of normal delivery, not side projects, and I value sustained curiosity that compounds judgement over time.

## Punk, then

Put together, these principles form a way of working, and living, that values:

- what works over what looks good  
- thinking for yourself  
- adapting without drama  
- staying curious and engaged  

That’s punk enough for me.

**Punk.**
