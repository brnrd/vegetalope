There is an old line:
> Ask and you shall receive.

It’s usually presented as a moral or spiritual idea. In practice, it’s much more concrete than that. At work, at home, and in life more broadly, many outcomes simply never happen because they were never clearly asked for.

Another saying in Scotland puts it more bluntly:  
> Shy bairns get naught.

## Asking is a prerequisite, not a guarantee

Asking does not mean demanding.  
It does not mean entitlement.  
And it does not guarantee a yes.

What it does is make change possible.

A promotion.  
A change of scope.  
More responsibility.  
Less responsibility.  
A move to a different team.  
A salary adjustment.  

None of these happen reliably by waiting, hoping, or doing good work in silence. Systems do not infer intent. People do not read minds.

If something matters to you, it has to be expressed.

## Being proactive about your own trajectory

Careers stall most often not because of lack of talent, but because of lack of explicit direction.

People stay stuck in roles where they can’t shine, not because there is no alternative, but because no one was told that they wanted one. Or because they assumed someone else would notice.

Your manager has a view of the organisation.  
You have a view of yourself.

Those two views only align if they are put on the table.

This sometimes means talking beyond your direct line manager.  
Not as politics, but as exploration. Understanding where needs exist, where your skills might fit, and what paths are realistically available.

Movement rarely starts with permission.  
It starts with a conversation.

## Promotions and compensation are conversations too

Promotions and salary raises are often framed as things that happen to you.

Sometimes they do. Often they don’t.

The uncomfortable truth is that organisations respond to risk and incentives. The cost of losing someone who performs and creates leverage is frequently higher than the cost of keeping them well-aligned and fairly compensated.

That equation only works in your favour if your intentions are visible.

Asking does not weaken your position.  
Silence usually does.

## This applies outside of work as well

The same pattern exists at home.

Needs that are not expressed turn into frustration.  
Desires that are not voiced turn into resentment.  
Assumptions replace clarity.

Asking is not selfish. It is a form of respect. It gives the other side something concrete to respond to instead of guessing.

## Ask. Then do.

Asking alone is not enough.

You ask, and you act in ways that make the ask coherent.  
You ask for scope, and you grow into it.  
You ask for trust, and you behave accordingly.  
You ask for change, and you participate in making it work.

This is not transactional. It’s directional.

Ask, clearly and honestly.  
Then do the work that makes the answer obvious.

Because in the end, the old sayings hold for a reason.

Ask and you shall receive.  
And shy bairns get naught.
