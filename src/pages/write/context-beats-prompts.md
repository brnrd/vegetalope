There is a lot of attention right now on prompt engineering.  
The right wording. The right structure. The magic incantation that unlocks better answers from an LLM.

Prompts matter. But they are not the main lever.

In practice, the quality of what you get out of an AI system is far more dependent on the quantity and quality of context you give it than on how clever your prompt is.

As an engineering manager, this matters a lot.

## Context is leverage

An engineering manager operates in a constant stream of fragmented information.

Pull requests spread across months.  
Code review comments.  
Slack discussions in public channels and DMs.  
One-to-one notes.  
Feedback from peers, product, and stakeholders.  
Objectives that evolved mid-year.  
Role expectations that were written once and never re-read.

No human can hold all of this in working memory. When we try, we fall back to shortcuts: recency bias, vague impressions, and incomplete narratives.

LLMs are not magical. But they are exceptionally good at absorbing large volumes of heterogeneous information and surfacing patterns that are hard to see piecemeal.

Only if you give them the data.

## The end-of-year review example

End-of-year reviews are a good illustration of the problem.

Most reviews are written from memory plus a handful of recent highlights. Even with the best intentions, this leads to distorted outcomes. Quiet contributors get overlooked. Early-year work fades. Behavioural patterns get reduced to anecdotes.

A better approach is not to “write a better prompt”.

A better approach is to load the system with context.

For example:
- All pull requests authored or significantly contributed to
- Code review comments left on other people’s work
- Notable Slack discussions in team channels
- Relevant DMs where decisions, mentoring, or support happened
- Existing role expectations and career path documentation
- Stated objectives for the period, even if they changed over time

Once this material is available, the AI can help surface trends:
- consistency or volatility
- ownership patterns
- collaboration style
- growth areas that emerge across months, not weeks

At that point, the prompt becomes almost secondary.

## Prompts shape output, data shapes insight

A good prompt is still important. It tells the system *what kind of output you want*.

Do you want:
- a structured summary?
- strengths and growth areas?
- evidence-backed statements?
- neutral wording versus developmental framing?

That is where prompt quality matters.

But no prompt can compensate for missing context.

A beautifully written instruction applied to shallow input produces shallow results. A simple instruction applied to rich context often produces surprisingly good ones.

As a manager, your leverage is not rhetorical.  
It is curatorial.

## Context reduces bias, not judgement

This is not about outsourcing evaluation to a machine.

The manager still decides.  
The manager still owns the feedback.  
The manager still applies judgement.

What context does is reduce blind spots.

It makes patterns visible that would otherwise be drowned out by memory, emotion, or organisational noise. It gives you a broader, calmer surface to reason from before you speak or write.

Used this way, AI does not replace judgement.  
It sharpens it.

## Think less like prompting, more like feeding

The mental shift is subtle but important.

Stop thinking in terms of:
> “How do I ask the right question?”

Start thinking in terms of:
> “What would a fair observer need to see to understand this situation?”

Documentation, history, expectations, artefacts, conversations. These are the raw materials.

When those are present, even a simple prompt like “Help me identify themes and growth areas” is often enough.

## The real constraint

The real limitation today is not AI capability.  
It is how little context we usually provide.

We are used to tools that operate on small inputs. LLMs are different. They reward completeness, not cleverness.

For engineering managers, this is an opportunity.

Not to automate people management, but to practice it with more consistency, more fairness, and more depth than memory alone allows.

Context beats prompts.
