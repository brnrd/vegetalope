Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew 7:7: 
> ask and you shall receive.

The phrase appears alongside “seek and you shall find” and “knock and the door shall be opened”. In context, it is not a promise of reward. It is a statement about action. Nothing is given if nothing is asked.

We often treat this as a spiritual idea, but it applies very concretely to everyday life. At work, at home, and in relationships, many outcomes never happen simply because they were never clearly requested.

There is a Scottish saying that expresses the same idea more bluntly: 
> Shy bairns get nowt. 

Shy children get nothing. If you do not ask, you should not expect to receive.

## Doing comes before asking, most of the time

In professional settings, asking only works when it follows action.

You don’t ask for more scope before showing you can handle it.  
You don’t ask for trust before behaving in a trustworthy way.  
You don’t ask for a promotion before already operating at the next level.

Action creates credibility. Asking makes that credibility visible.

But there is an important exception. Sometimes, you cannot act until you are given the opportunity to do so. Scope does not always present itself on its own. In those cases, the first thing to ask for is not a title or a reward, but a chance.

A chance to try.  
A chance to own a problem.  
A chance to operate at a slightly higher level.

That ask is not premature. It is what makes action possible.

## Do. Then ask. Or ask to do.

Careers most often stall not because of lack of ability, but because direction remains implicit. People do the work, but never connect it to what they want next. Or they wait for opportunities that never come.

Your manager has a view of the organisation. You have a view of your own trajectory. Those two only align through conversation, once intentions are explicit.

Sometimes this means talking beyond your direct line manager, not as politics, but as exploration. Understanding where needs exist, where opportunities could be created, and where you are willing to step in.

The same logic applies to promotions and compensation. Organisations respond to risk and incentives. The cost of losing someone who creates leverage is often higher than the cost of keeping them aligned and fairly compensated. That equation only works when contribution is visible and intent is known.

So the sequence matters, but it is flexible.

Do the work when you can.  
Ask for the opportunity when you can’t.  
Then ask, clearly and honestly, for what comes next.

Ask and you shall receive.
