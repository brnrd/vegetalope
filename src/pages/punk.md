## Punk

I stumbled upon [Travis Hubbard on X](https://twitter.com/wtravishubbard) recently, and was reading a [tweet](https://twitter.com/wtravishubbard/status/1716451033277190148) of his stating that "[we]'re all punks too". That hit close to home.

This got me thinking that I should come up with an engineering (management) principles based on being more punk.

This is what I came up with:

1. **Pragmatic**: Refers to a practical and results-oriented approach. In engineering or management, being pragmatic means focusing on solutions that work in the real world, making efficient use of resources, and prioritising actions that lead to tangible outcomes.

2. **Unconventional**: Embracing unconventional thinking means being open to creative and innovative solutions. It encourages us to explore new, non-traditional approaches, challenge the status quo, and consider out-of-the-box ideas.

3. **Nimble**: Being nimble is about adaptability and responsiveness. It's having the ability to quickly adjust strategies, plans, or processes in the face of changing circumstances, market shifts, or unexpected challenges.

4. **Keen**: A keen approach reflects a strong focus on knowledge and understanding. Engineers and managers who are "keen" prioritise staying informed, continuous learning, and a deep understanding of our field. It involves a passion for staying updated with the latest industry trends and insights.

These four principles together represent a dynamic and effective approach to engineering and management, emphasising practicality, innovation, adaptability, and a thirst for knowledge.

Punk!
