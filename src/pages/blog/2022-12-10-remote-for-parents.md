Like everyone, I wanted to play with ChatGPT.
I was suprised to be so aligned with its advice regarding the potential benefits of remote working as a parent.

Here's the unedited answer I got:

1. Save time and money on commuting: remote can be especially beneficial for parents who have young children and may need to be available to pick them up from school or childcare.
2. Flexibility to work around your children's schedules: it allows parents to have more flexibility in their schedule, which can make it easier to take care of their children and manage their family responsibilities.
3. Better work-life balance: remote work can help parents create a better work-life balance by allowing them to work when it is convenient for them and their family, rather than being tied to a traditional 9-5 work schedule.
4. Increased availability for your children: it can allow parents to be more present and available for their children, which can be especially beneficial for working parents who may have previously struggled to balance the demands of their job with their family responsibilities.
5. Higher job satisfaction: many find that they are more productive and happier when they are able to work from home, which can lead to higher job satisfaction. This is beneficial for parents who are able to work in a way that allows them to be more present for their children.

Note: this is, and will be, the only ChatGPT-made article you'll find in this blog. Pinky swear!
