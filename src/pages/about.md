My name is Bernard Debecker.

I’m a husband, a father of five, and a software engineer who mostly grew up on the frontend.

I was close to the UI, the browser, the product, and users. JavaScript, CSS, interfaces, performance, accessibility, shipping things that people touch. Over time, I became more T-shaped when needed: systems, teams, delivery. Still grounded in the same place though: reality.

I am currently head of engineering at AVIV Group, managing 7 EMs and 8 teams. Before that, I was a senior frontend engineer at FanDuel.

I like simple systems that hold under pressure.  
I’m interested in how decisions are made, how teams actually work, and how context changes everything. I care less about ideology and more about what survives contact with the real world.

Outside of work, life follows similar principles. We move more than average, own less than average, adapt often. I’ve been vegan for over sixteen years, remote for over a decade, and mildly allergic to unnecessary complexity.

This site is where I write to clarify my own thinking about my values and principles at the pace of which things actually happen.

Nothing here is a recipe.  
It’s just how I think, decide, and try to do things well, at work and at home.

Independent, curious, grounded.

Punk à chat.
