My name is Bernard Debecker.

I’m a husband, a father of five, and a frontend engineer at heart.

I am currently head of engineering at AVIV Group. Before that, I was a senior frontend engineer at FanDuel.

I like simple systems that hold under pressure.  
I’m interested in how decisions are made, how teams actually work, and how context changes everything.

Outside of work, life follows similar principles. We move more than average, own less than average, adapt often. We're from Belgium but have lived chronologically in Belgium, Scotland, England, France, Belgium, and France again.

I’ve been vegan for over sixteen years and have been working remotely for over a decade. The two are not related.
