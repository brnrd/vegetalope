This is a non-exhaustive list of films my wife and I have watched and genuinely enjoyed.

All the films listed here are ones we personally consider “good movies”: titles we find particularly strong, memorable, or meaningful in their own way, and that we would readily recommend or be happy to watch again.

The selection is deliberately personal rather than academic. It reflects our tastes, moods, and the kinds of films that tend to stay with us over time, without any claim to objectivity or completeness.
