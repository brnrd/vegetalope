This is a non-exhaustive list of films my wife and I have watched and enjoyed.

Some of them are simply good enough to recommend and to rewatch. Others go a step further and earn our more subjective “good movie” seal of approval: films we consider particularly strong, memorable, or important in their own way.

The distinction is intentionally personal rather than academic. It reflects taste, mood, and the kind of films that stay with us over time, rather than any claim to objectivity or completeness.
